The Massacre of Vk'nef
"When G'fen's punishment began, it was believed that the Vikshnar were involved in the creation and spread of the disease. 
The Third Way of G'fen proceeded, on the mere basis of a rumor, to attack the Vikshnar colony of Vk'nef.
Upon discovery that these G'fen extremists were going to do this, the only thing the council could do was send a messenger to the Vikshnar homeworld.
Our military arrived at Vk'nef half way through the massacre. Unfortunately, millions more died before the last of the murderers either fled or died.
Many Vikshnars were killed that day, and many more were radicalized. Many Gekrian fear that the Vikshnar will initiate a military campaign against us.
G'fen forgive us. We were but fools and murderers. We will be unable to atone for these sins.
K'tenm gorl s'den vyek dan G'fen. (You are unable to translate this last sentence.)
       - Y'kne the architect of compassion"
