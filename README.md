# Tamias Engine

A roguelike engine in Common LISP.
Tamias is the word for the genus classification of chipmunks, which are fast and lightweight, one of the primary goals of this engine.
Named so because there is already a library named chipmunk. This project is unaffiliated with that library.


NOTE


This engine is not ready for 'prime time'
There is still a lot of work to be done
